# java-short-definition-exercise

This project contains a python script that converts a simple definition of a java exercise from a json file into a Tests.java class.

Please refer to the ``how_to_write_an_exercise.md`` documentation
which explains all the different fields to set in your json file in order to write your exercise.

Futhermore, all the json you can find are examples of exercises from the course CS1_Java from INGInious.
